/**
 * The BaggingArea class represents a wrapper for a hardware driver of the
 * sensors in a bagging area. Because we're not really using such a device, our
 * class provides methods to change the weight reported by the bagging area, and
 * to zero that weight if we're resetting the system.<br>
 * <br>
 * The BaggingArea uses an <i>Observer</i> (or <i>Listener</i>) design pattern.
 * Objects which implement the <code>BaggingAreaListener</code> interface may
 * use the <code>attach()</code> method to register with the BaggingArea. When a
 * weight change event occurs, the BaggingArea reports the event to its
 * observers using their notify methods. In this example, we do not support
 * detaching from the BaggingArea.<br>
 * <br>
 * In the business logic of our system (implemented in SelfCheckOut) we use
 * known product weights to ascertain if the customer has placed an item in the
 * bagging area after scanning it. Until we see a (correct) weight change, we
 * would keep telling them to bag the item, and we would refuse to accept scans
 * of additional items.
