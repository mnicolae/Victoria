This is a manual test for updating a tuple in the BulkProduct relation.
It also contains the various assumptions that are made about the system's functionality.

Assumptions about the system's functionality
- The BIC attribute cannot be updated. 
- The Description attribute can be updated to anything, as in doing so it does not affect any constraints.
- The Unit price attribute can only be updated to valid values. That is, positive double values.
- The same assumption applies to the Whole Sale price attribute.
- The Taxable category attribute can only be modified to a value that exists in the Tax Categories table.
